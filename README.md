# GitHub Demo
 Demo for GitHub use:

 - Create the repository
 - Create a file in the main branch
 - Create a local branch for development
 - Push the new branch to the repository
 - Open a pull request
 - Roll back to revert to a previous version

Best practices (outside the scope of this course):
- Prepare unit tests and calculate test coverage
- Run tests before accepting a pull request
